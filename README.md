Student Management System Project 

Project Title: Student Management System in C++

Objective:
The main objective of this project is to create a basic console-based application that allows the user to manage student records. It demonstrates the use of structures, file handling, and input/output operations in C++.

Features:

Add Student: Users can enter student details such as Roll Number, Name, and Marks, which are stored permanently in a text file.

View Students: The system allows retrieval and display of stored student records from the file.

File Handling: The project uses ofstream and ifstream to manage data in students.txt.

Data Storage: Records are maintained in a structured format for easy management and future use.

Technology Used:

Language: C++

Concepts: Structures, File Handling, Input/Output streams

Conclusion:
This project provides a simple yet effective way to manage student records. It is helpful for beginners to understand the implementation of persistent data storage in C++ and serves as a foundation for developing more advanced student management systems.
